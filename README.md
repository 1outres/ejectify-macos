# Ejectify for Mac

[Ejectify](https://ejectify.app) automatically unmounts external volumes when your Mac starts sleeping, and mounts them again after it wakes up. It becomes handy when you have connected a USB drive to an external display that gets powered off when your Mac starts sleeping, causing the drive to be ejected forcefully.

## Frequently asked questions

### The app doesn't start. What can I do?

Make sure [Ejectify](https://ejectify.app) runs from your Applications folder. It will only start from there. Also, note that the app lives in your system's status bar. There's no other user interface that pops up when you start it.

### Why do I still receive notifications?

Ejectify works by (trying to) unmount volumes (on external disks) before your screensaver starts, screen locks, display(s) turns off, or the system starts sleeping. Sometimes this doesn't result in the desired behavior. In this case, try the following:

- Ensure the correct volumes are checked in Ejectify's status bar menu. Ejectify will only attempt to unmount those.

- Toggle between the various `Unmount when` options. Depending on your (hardware) configuration, some options work better than others.

- In case you've connected the disk via a USB hub, temporarily attach it directly to your Mac and test if that makes a difference.

- Temporary check `Force unmount` to see if that makes a difference. This (unsafe) option (almost) immediately eject disks, even when apps or macOS are still using it, which could result in data loss. When this resolves the issue, it's likely that an app or macOS is causing the issue. See [this page](https://serverfault.com/a/159428) to find out which app.

- Use the [Console app](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/console/welcome/mac) to see if any warnings or errors are popping up that might indicate why Ejectify isn't able to (un)mount the disk. Specifically look for a message starting with `Dissenter status`, which includes the result of the (un)mount process.
