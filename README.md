# Ejectify for Mac

[Ejectify](https://ejectify.app) automatically unmounts external volumes when your Mac starts sleeping, and mounts them again after it wakes up. It becomes handy when you have connected a USB drive to an external display that gets powered off when your Mac starts sleeping, causing the drive to be ejected forcefully.
