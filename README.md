# Ejectify for Mac

Ejectify is a simple but useful menu bar app, that automatically unmounts external volumes when your Mac starts sleeping, and mounts them again after your Mac wakes up. It becomes handy when you have connected a USB drive to an external display that gets powered off when your Mac starts sleeping, causing the drive to be ejected forcefully.
